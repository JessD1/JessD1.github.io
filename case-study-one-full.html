							<h1>Retire Online</h1>
									<h2>A tool to help pensioners manage complex retirement options.</h2>
									<p>I worked with a financial public corporation* to design this digital product for their pension compensation scheme members.</p>
									<p><I>Retire Online</i> was driven by four key business goals:</p>
									<ol>
										<li>Enhance the self service offering on the customer facing website</li>
										<li>Support an organisation-wide digital transformation</li>
										<li>Reduce administration costs by decreasing retirements by post and phone</li>
										<li>Provide members with more choice as part of a multi-channel customer service strategy</li>
									</ol>
									<h2>The challenge</h2>
									<ul>
										<li>The language used in pensions is often complex and full of jargon.</li>
										<li>65 per cent of the user base are, or were, employed in traditional blue collar industries involving limited use of computers.</li>
										<li>The majority of users are over 55 and websites are 43 per cent harder to use for over 65’s as they are for younger users [<i>Senior Citizens (Ages 65 and older) on the Web</i>, 2nd Edition, Nielsen Norman Group].</li>
									</ul>
									<div class="highlight-copy"><h2>Problem statement</h2><p><strong>Retiring is complicated. Many calculations are performed behind the scenes, many personal details are collected. How might we make this complex process simple for web users who are older and less confident transacting online?</strong></p>

								<h1>1</h1>
								<h2>Use strictly plain English copy</h2>
								<p>Avoid jargon and antiquated language that alienates users. Keep sentences short. Use active verbs. Use ‘you’ and ‘we’. Break content into chunks using headings and lists. Use everyday conversational language. Provide on-screen instructions.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="box-two">
								<h1>2</h1>
								<h2>Guide users through every step gradually</h2>
								<p>Use the right progressive disclosure strategy to avoid cognitive overload. Spread out multi-stage processes and gradually introduce new information. Use UI patterns that work for users with decreased motor skills or poor eyesight. Follow Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="box-three">
								<h1>3</h1>
								<h2>Minimise the opportunity for errors</h2>
								<p>Use in-line form validation to provide live feedback, making the results of each action immediately apparent. Assume that every possible mishap will happen and protect against it. Make actions reversible. Make errors less costly for the user. Be sure to assist rather than punish or scold the user.</p>

								<h2>Behaviours and Habits</h2>
									<ul>
										<li>Finds track pads hard to control - prefers using a mouse or a tablet.</li>
										<li>Looks for colour, shape and cursor changes to indicate a link.</li>
										<li>When Anne can't find her reading glasses she uses the browser settings to increase the text size on a web page.</li>
										<li>If she doesn’t get the hang of a website straight away, she will call her daughter or the company helpline for assistance.</li>
									</ul>
								<h2>Anne’s Goals</h2>
									<ul>
										<li>To find out her retirement options and model different scenarios - retiring at 66, retiring at 68, etc.</li>
										<li>To feel confident she has been given clear facts to inform her decisions.</li>
										<li>To feel confident the website she is using is secure and won’t leave her vulnerable to fraud.</li>
										<li>To have full control over her financial future and avoid relying on expensive IFAs or advice from her employer.</li>
								</ul>
								<h2>Anne’s Frustrations</h2>
									<ul>
										<li>Anne doesn’t like time-consuming web forms that ask her for lots of personal information.</li>
										<li>Anne’s computer skills are fairly basic, she needs to ask her daughter to help her with anything too technical.</li>
										<li>Anne thinks arranging her finances is a chore, she wants it to be a simple and engaging process.</li>
										<li>Anne doesn’t like technical jargon, she wants to know about her pension in plain English.</li>

								<h2>Validating assumptions through user interviews</h2>
								<p>After my intial research, I spoke to a group of people aged 55+ to see how they <i>actually</i> felt about using websites to manage their finances. I screened 15 interviewees and chose four participants who had needs aligned with the needs of the <strong>persona</strong> I'd created. I asked them to tell me about a time they'd used the web for a financial service. I wanted to find out:</p>
								<ol>
									<li>Do users aged 55+ feel comfortable using websites for banking, insurance quotes and buying other financial products?</li>
									<li>What do they find easy and what do they find challenging when using the web to perform these tasks?</li>
									<li>Where do they tend to drop out of the process when they are using complex web forms?</li>
									<li>How do they understand complex or lengthy financial information?</li>
								</ol>
								<p>I synthesised my findings using an <strong>affinity mapping</strong> technique...</p>

								<h1>Scope and restraints</h1>
							</div>
							<div class="box-one">
								<h2>1. Little appetite for innovation</h2>
								<p>The organisation had been doing things the same way for a long time. There was little appetite for innovation from senior stakeholders who were reluctant to allocate resource to user testing.</p>
								<p>I tackled this by proactively going out and conducting my own user tests and drumming up enthusiasm from other parts of the business.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="box-two">
								<h2>2. No direct competitors</h2>
								<p>The organisation is a statutory public corporation accountable to Parliament through the Department for Work and Pensions. This meant that they were not a profit-driven organisation and had no direct competitors. This made competition benchmarking a challenge.</p>
								<p>I overcame this by looking at how users used multi-stage processes when attaining quotes in other related industries like insurance. Other organisations in the pensions space provided a good benchmark for of how to create jargon-busting copy.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="box-three">
								<h2>3. Restrictive administration software</h2>
								<p>Retire Online was a feature to be added to an existing customer facing website. This website was developed by an external software company and integrated with their pension administration software. Updates could be made in real time.</p>
								<p>This meant, we didn’t have full control over the development of Retire Online or full access to the process maps.</p>
								<p>On the plus side, having access to an existing live website, provided me with good analytic insights into what was already working well for members.</p>
							</div>
						</div><!--flex-grid-section-->

					<div class="casestudy-content"><!--col-one-->
								<h2>Mapping the user journey</h2>
								<p>Before I could begin sketching a solution, I needed to map out the user journey. There were many possible routes through the process. For example, some users would have the option to choose an amount to take as a tax-free lump sum with their monthly pension, and others would be required to take a fixed lump sum amount based on their pension scheme rules.</p>
								<p>I created the journey map below to demonstrate how the users would move through the product based on their particular retirement scenario.</p>

					<div class="casestudy-content"><!--col-one-->
								<h2>Sketching and wireframing</h2>
								<p>I started sketching the layout on paper to help me think about navigation and the how to structure elements in a way that would guide the user through the multi-stage quote process.</p>
								<p>Analytics showed 86 per cent of users were accessing the website on a desktop or tablet. I chose to use the dimension of an iPad Pro as my template.</p>
								<p>Once I had mapped out the elements on paper and gathered feedback from key stakeholders in the business, I moved on to create lo-fidelity wireframes using Sketch App and <strong>tested</strong> these with my users.</p>

						<div class="prototyping">
							<h2>Prototyping and user testing</h2>
								<p>Next, I turned the lo-fi wireframes into paper prototypes and tested them with my users. I gathered their feedback.</p>
									<ul>What was working well:
										<li>The progress bar letting them know which step they were in the overall process.</li>
										<li>The large buttons with high affordance.</li>
									</ul>
								<ul>What needed improving:
									<li>The readability of the text (larger or not enough contrast)</li>
									<li>The lump sum slider needs a more explicit affordance to let users know they can interact with it.</li>
								</ul>
							<p>I made adjustments based on the user feedback and created high-fidelity wireframes. I worked on the copy and on-screen instructions. I turned my high-fidelity wireframes into a clickable prototype in Invision.</p>
							<p>I brought this interactive prototype to my users and gathered more feedback.I repeated this process of testing, gathering feedback and creating a new iteration of my interfaces two more times.</p><!--flex-grid-section-->

											<h2>Accessibility</h2>
											<p><strong>Text size incrementer:</strong> I tested the prototype with and without a text size incrementer widget at the top of the page. During testing most users did not notice the widget.</p>
											<p>Building the website using standard readable fonts, a large default font size, and using ems instead px so the fonts resize correctly when the user adjusts the font size via the standard browser controls should be enough to help most users who have trouble reading smaller copy.</p>
											<p><strong>Colour blind tests and contrast ratios:</strong> The ability to perceive colour can gradually lessen with age. I ran the website through software that . I kept the contrast ratio above 8.52 for maximum legibility.</p>
											<p>After development was complete, I used JAWS screen-reading software to evaluate web accessibility.</p>

								<h2>Outcomes</h2>
								<p>Retire Online launched in March 2017 to audience of 28,000 members. This has now grown to 39,000 members. Key stats:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>An average 32 retirements online each week</li>
									<li>Over 1,000 retirements since launch</li>
									<li>One third of all retirements proccessed by the business are now done online</li>
									<li>80.6 per cent satisfaction with the overal member website</li>
								</ul>
								<div class="highlight-copy"><h2>A user's story</h2><p><strong>"I didn’t expect retiring online tobe so easy and hassle free. The website is really easy to use. You don’t need to be a whizz on the computer to get around at all and retiring online was literally as simple as clicking a button. My husband had to wait until the paperwork had been sent out, returned and processed before he could receive his first pension payment. My money arrived in my bank account within a week."</strong></p>
